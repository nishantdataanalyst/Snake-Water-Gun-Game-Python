Developed a Python-based console game applying data logic and conditional analysis to simulate 100+ randomized outcomes with zero execution errors. Optimized decision-mapping efficiency through dictionary-based data structures and implemented user input validation for 100% accurate result evaluation. Strengthened analytical and programming skills in logic building, data validation, and structured output reportingâ€”core competencies relevant to data analysis and automation.
